## Course Concept

**It addresses a fundamental issue in System Design and Management:** The need for engineering leaders to recognize uncertainty in the performance of their plans or designs. How should we analyze and cope with risks in demand, requirements, cost, technology, etc.?      
This course presents Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Excel models, simulation, and decision analysis as primary ways to analyze possible outcomes of design and management strategies.      
**The learning objective** is to provide an overall view of the use, benefit, and mechanics of essential tools for Risk and Decision Analysis. Specifically, to learn that:      
1\. You can’t really avoid uncertainty (as design processes often do).      
2\. Because, if you do, you get inferior results—and sometimes major financial losses.      
3\. So, you need to address uncertainty proactively as part of design process.      
4\. You can choose between methods based on the circumstances.      
**A quiz in mid-October validates your understanding of the class material**.

## Flipped Classroom

Course instruction will be principally based on the concept of the “flipped” classroom. This approach reverses the traditional, almost medieval, structure in which students first attend lectures and then work through their questions as best they can. Instead, students are to review and question the material before the in-person classes, which we will then devote to faculty-led discussion responding to student reactions to the material. This is possible thanks to our accumulated recordings of zoom lectures. Experience this Spring demonstrated that the “flipped” classroom greatly improves student learning.

We will post “lecture” material in advance of each class. Students will respond to these “pre-reads” on Google Forms, highlighting their issues, queries, and doubts. These responses will help the instructors identify important points to address and respond to the class.      
The responses to “pre-reads” will not be graded. But they will count toward class participation which will be 30% of the student grade! Full credit for participation if you respond on time, otherwise not.

## Grading 

Course grades will be a weighted average of:    
• Participation (Pre-reads) 30%    
• 3 Homework Assignments 36% (Equal weight on each assignment)    
• Quiz 34%

## Academic Honesty

To avoid confusion that might arise from different expectations in other contexts or establishments please note the MIT standards that apply in this subject.

•       Assignments turned in for grading must be done individually. We understand that students will discuss the course and often learn best collectively. However, you should each prepare your own reports for each assignment, in your own format and words.

•       Demonstrated evidence of copying (exactly the same presentation, same wording of sentences, etc.) will result in zeroes for each assignment involved.

•       Anyone found cheating in the quiz (copying from another student or using unauthorized materials) will receive a zero for the event.

•       Students must properly cite all material from other sources (web pages, articles, reports, etc.). Evidence that students have taken material from elsewhere without citation will be an indication of plagiarism.

•       Prof. de Neufville will place a note in the record of each student associated with plagiarism or cheating. MIT views these infractions seriously and routinely expels students who have flagrantly violated the MIT’s academic standards.

•       Please contact Prof. de Neufville if you have any questions about this policy.
